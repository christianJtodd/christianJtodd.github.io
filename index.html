	<h2>What we do</h2>
	<p>Here at Doinkâ€™s Donuts, we commit to customer satisfaction and creating a positive work environment for out employees. We have been home to the best donuts in Australia since we were founded in 1965. Our first store was opened in Melbourne, then expanded to every state in Australia in 1971. We were founded by the one and only Chef Doink, who had a passion for starting his own food business. We record over 100,000 orders everyday all around the county. How do we do this? We ensure our customers have the best experience possible, through trust and respect from our workers!</p>
